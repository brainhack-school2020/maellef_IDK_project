## Presentation

I'm a first year PhD student working on Deep Learning encoding models of auditory processing in the brain. I'm of course interested by cognitive neurosciences in general, and some of these related topics : fmri, audition, higher cognitive functions, temporal perception, ... For almost 3 years, I've also followed some programming courses, and I'm interested by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning !

## Project definition

### Background
My PhD project is part of a bigger project, the Courtois Neuromod. 
![cneuromod_logo]()
[link to the cNeuromod official website](https://www.cneuromod.ca/)

This project has for goal to model brain processes using AI, and to further improve our understanding of our dear brain's inner work. One important feature of the cNeuromod project is the creation of an extensive dataset of 6 subjects brains, with fMRI, MEG and biosignals recordings. 
For now I only used a small part of this dataset, and I wish to delve more into it. Through this project, I want to create a dashboard of the dataset, so that anyone working on the project can visualize the current state of the dataset. 

   This project is made during BrainHack School 2020 ! 

### Tools

I already have some experience with the folowing tools :
- Python :
  - numpy, pandas, ...
  - matplotlib (but i'm clearly not the best)
  - nilearn, scikit-learn
  - Pytorch
- Git, GitHub

In this project, I want to learn more on :

- containerization : Docker, conda venv, ... 
- project management : pyBids, cookiecutter ?
- Dash by plotly : [plotly official website](https://plotly.com/dash/)

more to come !

### Data
